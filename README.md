Code for a flask-ask server, that can be used as the basis for an alexa skill, that tells you about planes flying overhead.

The skill for Alexa will be made using Flask-Ask. For establishing connection we will be using ngrok. ngrok establishes a HTTP tunnel from Raspberry Pi to Alexa. The endpoint url will change every time ngrok is restarted, as an alternative you can use pagekite.
